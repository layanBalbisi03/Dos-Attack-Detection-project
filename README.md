The utilization of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and their prevalence expose these networks to a multitude of security threats. To counteract these threats, it becomes imperative to employ a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The identification of these attacks poses a significant challenge, particularly in the context of detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks [3].
This project provides a comprehensive empirical study aims at examining several Ensemble learning using a new specialized, published dataset for WSN networks (named as WSN-DS). The purpose is to provide an efficient IDS for detecting critical Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which have a serious impact on the services provided by WSNs.
In this repository, we share the code and data for reproducability.
